           I never evaluated extracurricular activities just as a source of enjoyment.They provide us a venue for more social interaction <br>
           and also considerably contribute to garner a sense of commitment and cultivate various skills by which we can fulfill and <br>
           enrich the academic experience.<br>
          For 5 years, I have been a member of ICT Masters organization, initiated by UNESCO’s Learning For the Future project,<br>
          which opened up new avenues for me to grasp the fundamentals of IT and upgrade my skillset of programming and<br>
          problem-solving, thus, by the virtue of my praiseworthy performance, I ranked to the advanced status within<br>
          a short time frame. <br>
          Participation in Olympiads encompasses an extensive part of my curricular activities.Being awarded a silver medal at <br>
          Republic Olympiad led me down the path to greater successes, as I was qualified both to the national team for the First <br>
          European Junior Olympiad and to the preparation center of gifted children, organized by the Ministry of Education of <br>
          Azerbaijan, for participation in the international Olympiads. As a member of the national informatics team, I participated <br>
          at the International Olympiad in Informatics 2019, in the final of All-Russian School Programming Olympiad 2019,<br>
          InfoCup 2019, Moscow Workshops Juniors, Asia-Pacific Informatics Olympiad 2020.Olympiads that I have involved in,<br>
          made me acquire a range of skills in programming and learn a lot about algorithms, and data structures, and most <br>
          importantly,I became more goal-oriented person.

              but luck always gives a chance to those who are not successful at least once."</h2>

           I was born and raised in Jalilabad. In 2009, I started my first education at school No. 1 named after Nizami Ganjavi in <br>
           ​​Jalilabad. Since 2016, I had continued my secondary education at Bilasuvar Lyceum named after our national hero Mubariz <br>
           Ibrahimov. <br>

           The basis of my education and personal life is participation in various competitions and projects. I had been <br>
           volunteering during my high school years, and since 2019 I have been a volunteer of the “Genc Konullu” organization. <br>
           I was invited as a volunteer to the Republic Youth Forum in 2019. I also had scout activity in early lyceum years.  <br>

           I spent the last years of my high school life only on scientific-engineering activities and Olympiads. I always believed <br>
           that I would be successful, especially if I pursued my interest in physics from an early age. Initially in 2019, I had <br>
           participated in a competition at Baku Engineering University, and I got a bronze medal because of "Finding a new energy <br>
           source-piezoelectric crystal". I had also participated in lots of Olympiads. Thus, in 2019, I got a bronze medal from the <br>
           second International Olympiad of the Talent Preparation Laboratory. I had also gotten bronze and silver medal from <br>
           Republic Physics Olympiads twice (2019 and 2020). But I would say that the most memorable and successful part of my <br>
           Olympic career was to represent our country in physics at the International Zhautikov Olympiad in Kazakhstan in 2020. <br>
           Participation in all these Olympiads and achievements inspired me to work harder on the path I am continuing. <br>
           In the later stages of my career, I had the opportunity to become interested not only in competitions, but also in <br>
           physics projects. And I thought about how I could use my physics skills to help others. Thus, I made contributions to be <br>
           created the book called "Elektrodinamika". This book was a great source of information on the problems used in the <br>
           International Physics Olympiads held within the framework of the grant competition of the Ministry of Education. <br>

           After graduating Bilasuvar Lyceum with gold medal, I got 654 points from DIM exams, since 2020, I have been studying <br>
           at ADA University, Computer Engineering. There we also have Science Club at ADA University that targets to support <br>
           every enthusiastic science lover. <br>

          <h2>"Opportunities don’t happen, you create them."</h2>
          <p>
            My name is Alkim, and I am from Turkey. I was living in Moscow, Russia, before coming to Azerbaijan, and now I have <br>
            been living in Baku for five years. Thanks to my education in Russia and Azerbaijan, I could learn Russian and <br>
            English beside Turkish, however, I have never lived in Turkey before.<br>

            I have always been doing numerous sports since my childhood; I have played basketball for three years, swam for over <br>
            four years, rode horse at steeplechase for four years and playing tennis for two years now. Furthermore, I also have <br>
            had a musical education since I was a child; I played piano for seven years, violin for three years, and now I am <br>
            learning to play electro guitar.  <br>

            I had my high school education under the International Bachelor system, and I received classes named “International <br>
            Technology in Global Society”. Thus, I gained a background about the computer sciences and programming (especially <br>
            website programming and HTML language). Moreover, I designed a wide-ranged website for a school project during my <br>
            high school years. <br>

            I always participated in national summer science camps held in Turkey every year, hence, I have a strong background <br>
            in natural sciences, especially in biology. Besides that, I often participated in social activities; for instance, <br>
            I participated in a national theatre competition held in Russia, to represent my school, and I and my teammate won <br>
            the first place, and I was additionally rewarded as the best participant in the competition. Moreover, I participated <br>
            in Baku International Model United Nations Conference, again representing my school.<br>

            I organized various social events in my high school too; for example, I have a hobby of taking professional pictures, <br>
            therefore, my high school held several picture galleries for me. Besides, I organized kermises and school trips to <br>
            national museums in Baku.<br>

            After graduation from high school, I was accepted in ADA university. Now I am in my first year in department of Computer <br>
            Engineering. Unfortunately, due to the pandemic period, I am having online education, however, I am looking forward for <br>
            the end where everyone can have a safe, healthy daily life and be able to go to ADA university personally. <br>
